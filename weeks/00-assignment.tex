\subsubsection*{1b}
Give an algorithm which provides an exact (\alpha = 1) estimate and makes $O(n \log n)$ queries, and (briefly) justify its correctness.
discussed halfway through 13 August 

We have a graph and the algorithm takes a vertex and the algorithm asks how many edges it has or who is its neighbor

I think this is coverage from week 3?
