Experiment
Shuffle a deck of cards, go through in order. How many times do 2 consecutive cards have the same suit?

\subsection{Linearity of expectation}
...The sum of each little thing
\[\Expectation [ X + Y ] = \Expectation[X] + \Expectation[Y]\]
No assumption of independence or anything. Surprisingly useful. 

Prove
Expectation of selecting a card of type 1
1/13

sum of all expecations 
Xi depends on 2 cards. What's Pr

Probability of 
52 C 13
E[Xi] = Pr[Xi = 1] 


Note: difference between Expectation and Probability.
Probability = the likelihood of the event e.g. selecting 2 consecutive suit cards from a deck of 52
Expectation = the average outcome. Multiply each outcome by it's probability.

Question
I have an array with n = 100
index of an even number
what is time complexity of getting even numbers
Theta n

- why isn't this constant? because you can create an algorithm that only selects 

"on expectation", the las Vegas

exepcted time 
For all expectation [Ta] = sum from infiintiy i = 1, i Pr [takes i attempts to find an even number]
\[
    \Expectation[T_a] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} i \cdot \Pr[\text{takes $i$ attempts to find an even number}]
\]
\[
    = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{i}{2^i} = O(1)    
\]


Why Randomization?


Faster, Simpler Algo'S
- miller rabin, it's a monte carlo algo. 
Runs in $O tilde n^2$

Quicksort
Expected running time 
Is it Las Vegas or Monte Carlo?
It's always going to return the sorted array, so it's Las Vegas.
Proof:
T(n) = Expectations[runtime on array size n]
T(n) = E[T(|A1|)] + E[T(|A2|)] + O(n)
We know |A1| + |A2| = n-1 |Why n-1?
